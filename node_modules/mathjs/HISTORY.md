## 2014-04-24, version 0.21.0

- Implemented trigonometric hyperbolic functions `cosh`, `coth`, `csch`,
  `sech`, `sinh`, `tanh`. Thanks Rogelio J. Baucells (@rjbaucells).
- Added property `type` to all expression nodes in a node tree.
- Fixed functions `log`, `log10`, `pow`, and `sqrt` not supporting complex
  results from BigNumber input (like `sqrt(bignumber(-4))`).


## 2014-04-16, version 0.20.0

- Switched to module `decimal.js` for BigNumber support, instead of
  `bignumber.js`.
- Implemented support for polar coordinates to the `Complex` datatype.
  Thanks Finn Pauls (@finnp).
- Implemented BigNumber support for functions `exp`, `log`, and `log10`.
- Implemented conditional operator `a ? b : c` in expression parser.
- Improved floating point comparison: the functions now check whether values
  are nearly equal, against a configured maximum relative difference `epsilon`.
  Thanks Rogelio J. Baucells (@rjbaucells).
- Implemented function `norm`. Thanks Rogelio J. Baucells (@rjbaucells).
- Improved function `ifElse`, is now specified for special data types too.
- Improved function `det`. Thanks Bryan Cuccioli (@bcuccioli).
- Implemented `BigNumber` support for functions `det` and `diag`.
- Added unit alias `lbs` (pound mass).
- Changed configuration option `decimals` to `precision` (applies to BigNumbers
  only).
- Fixed support for element-wise comparisons between a string and a matrix.
- Fixed: expression parser now trows IndexErrors with one-based indices instead
  of zero-based.
- Minor bug fixes.


## 2014-03-30, version 0.19.0

- Implemented functions `compare`, `sum`, `prod`, `var`, `std`, `median`.

  improved performance of both functions `combinations` and `permutations`.


## 2014-01-18, version 0.18.0

- Changed matrix index notation of expression parser from round brackets to
  square brackets, for example `A[1, 1:3]` instead of `A(1, 1:3)`.
- Removed need to use the `function` keyword for function assignments in the
  expression parser, you can define a function now like `f(x) = x^2`.
- Implemented a compilation step in the expression parser: expressions are
  compiled into JavaScript, giving much better performance (easily 10x as fast).
- Renamed unit conversion function and operator `in` to `to`. Operator `in` is
  still available in the expression parser as an alias for `to`. Added unit
  `in`, an abbreviation for `inch`. Thanks Elijah Insua (@tmpvar).
- Added plurals and aliases for units.

  Added settings `number.defaultType` and `number.precision` to configure
  big numbers.
- Documentation is extended.
- Removed utility functions `isScalar`, `toScalar`, `isVector`, `toVector`
  from `Matrix` and `Range`. Use `math.squeeze` and `math.size` instead.
- Implemented functions `get` and `set` on `Matrix`, for easier and faster
  retrieval/replacement of elements in a matrix.
- Implemented function `resize`, handling matrices, scalars, and strings.
- Functions `ones` and `zeros` now return an empty matrix instead of a
  number 1 or 0 when no arguments are provided.
- Implemented functions `min` and `max` for `Range` and `Index`.
- Resizing matrices now leaves new elements undefined by default instead of
  filling them with zeros. Function `resize` now has an extra optional
  parameter `defaultValue`.
- Range operator `:` in expression parser has been given a higher precedence.
- Functions don't allow arguments of unknown type anymore.
- Options be set when constructing a math.js instance or using the new function
  `config(options`. Options are no longer accessible via `math.options`.
- Renamed `scientific` notation to `exponential` in function `format`.
- Function `format` outputs exponential notation with positive exponents now
  always with `+` sign, so outputs `2.1e+3` instead of `2.1e3`.

- Some fixes and performance improvements in the `resize` and `subset`
  functions.
- Function `size` now adheres to the option `matrix.defaultType` for scalar
  input.
- Minor bug fixes.


## 2013-10-26, version 0.15.0

- Math.js must be instantiated now, static calls are no longer supported. Usage:
  - node.js: `var math = require('mathjs')();`
  - browser: `var math = mathjs();`
- Implemented support for multiplying vectors with matrices.
- Improved number formatting:
  - Function `format` now support various options: precision, different
    notations (`fixed`, `scientific`, `auto`), and more.
  - Numbers are no longer rounded to 5 digits by default when formatted.
  - Implemented a function `format` for `Matrix`, `Complex`, `Unit`, `Range`,
    and `Selector` to format using options.
  - Function `format` does only stringify values now, and has a new parameter
    `precision` to round to a specific number of digits.
  - Removed option `math.options.precision`,
    use `math.format(value [, precision])` instead.
  - Fixed formatting numbers as scientific notation in some cases returning
    a zero digit left from the decimal point. (like "0.33333e8" rather than
    "3.3333e7"). Thanks @husayt.
- Implemented a function `print` to interpolate values in a template string,
  this functionality was moved from the function `format`.
- Implemented statistics function `mean`. Thanks Guillermo Indalecio Fernandez
  (@guillermobox).
- Extended and changed `max` and `min` for multi dimensional matrices: they now
  return the maximum and minimum of the flattened array. An optional second
  argument `dim` allows to calculate the `max` or `min` for specified dimension.
- Renamed option `math.options.matrix.default` to
  `math.options.matrix.defaultType`.
- Removed support for comparing complex numbers in functions `smaller`,
  `smallereq`, `larger`, `largereq`. Complex numbers cannot be ordered.


## 2013-10-08, version 0.14.0

- Introduced an option `math.options.matrix.default` which can have values
  `matrix` (default) or `array`. This option is used by the functions `eye`,
  `ones`, `range`, and `zeros`, to determine the type of matrix output.
- Getting a subset of a matrix will automatically squeeze the resulting subset,
  setting a subset of a matrix will automatically unsqueeze the given subset.
- Removed concatenation of nested arrays in the expression parser.
  You can now input nested arrays like in JavaScript. Matrices can be
  concatenated using the function `concat`.
- The matrix syntax `[...]` in the expression parser now creates 1 dimensional
  matrices by default. `math.eval('[1,2,3,4]')` returns a matrix with
  size `[4]`, `math.eval('[1,2;3,4]')` returns a matrix with size `[2,2]`.
- Documentation is restructured and extended.
- Fixed non working operator `mod` (modulus operator).


## 2013-09-03, version 0.13.0

- Implemented support for booleans in all relevant functions.
- Implemented functions `map` and `forEach`. Thanks Sebastien Piquemal (@sebpic).
- All construction functions can be used to convert the type of variables,
  also element-wise for all elements in an Array or Matrix.
- Changed matrix indexes of the expression parser to one-based with the
  upper-bound included, similar to most math applications. Note that on a
  JavaScript level, math.js uses zero-based indexes with excluded upper-bound.
- Removed support for scalars in the function `subset`, it now only supports
  Array, Matrix, and String.
- Removed the functions `get` and `set` from a selector, they are a duplicate
  of the function `subset`.
- Replaced functions `get` and `set` of `Matrix` with a single function
  `subset`.
- Some moving around with code and namespaces:
  - Renamed namespace `math.expr` to `math.expression` (contains Scope, Parser,
    node objects).
  - Renamed namespace `math.docs` to `math.expression.docs`.
  - Moved `math.expr.Selector` to `math.chaining.Selector`.
- Fixed some edge cases in functions `lcm` and `xgcd`.


## 2013-08-22, version 0.12.1

- Fixed a broken unit test.


## 2013-08-22, version 0.12.0

- Implemented functions `random([min, max])`, `randomInt([min, max])`,
  `pickRandom(array)`. Thanks Sebastien Piquemal (@sebpic).
- Implemented function `distribution(name)`, generating a distribution object
  with functions `random`, `randomInt`, `pickRandom` for different
  distributions. Currently supporting `uniform` and `normal`.
- Changed the behavior of `range` to exclude the upper bound, so `range(1, 4)`
  now returns `[1, 2, 3]` instead of `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Changed the syntax of `range`, which is now `range(start, end [, step])`
  instead of `range(start, [step, ] end)`.
- Changed the behavior of `ones` and `zeros` to geometric dimensions, for
  example `ones(3)` returns a vector with length 3, filled with ones, and
  `ones(3,3)` returns a 2D array with size [3, 3].
- Changed the return type of `ones` and `zeros`: they now return an Array when
  arguments are Numbers or an Array, and returns a Matrix when the argument
  is a Matrix.
- Change matrix index notation in parser from round brackets to square brackets,
  for example `A[0, 0:3]`.
- Removed the feature introduced in v0.10.0 to automatically convert a complex
  value with an imaginary part equal to zero to a number.
- Fixed zeros being formatted as null. Thanks @TimKraft.


## 2013-07-23, version 0.11.1

- Some fixes in the end user documentation.


## 2013-07-08, version 0.10.0

- For complex calculations, all functions now automatically replace results
  having an imaginary part of zero with a Number. (`2i * 2i` now returns a
  Number `-4` instead of a Complex `-4 + 0i`).
- Implemented support for injecting custom node handlers in the parser. Can be
  used for example to implement a node handler for plotting a graph.
- Implemented end user documentation and a new `help` function.
- Functions `size` and `squeeze` now return a Matrix instead of an Array as
  output on Matrix input.
- Added a constant tau (2 * pi). Thanks Zak Zibrat (@palimpsests).
- Renamed function `unaryminus` to `unary`.
- Fixed a bug in determining node dependencies in function assignments.

- Implemented function `math.parse(expr [,scope])`. Optional parameter scope can
  be a plain JavaScript Object containing variables.
- Extended function `math.expr(expr [, scope])` with an additional parameter
  `scope`, similar to `parse`. Example: `math.eval('x^a', {x:3, a:2});`.
- Implemented function `subset`, to get or set a subset from a matrix, string,
  or other data types.
- Implemented construction functions number and string (mainly useful inside
  the parser).
- Improved function `det`. Thanks Bryan Cuccioli (@bcuccioli).
- Moved the parse code from prototype math.expr.Parser to function math.parse,
  simplified Parser a little bit.

- Implemented a command line interface. When math.js is installed globally via
  npm, the application is available on your system as 'mathjs'.
- Implemented `end` keyword for index operator, and added support for implicit
  start and end (expressions like `a(2,:)` and `b(2:end,3:end-1)` are supported
  now).

  Thanks @FJS2.


## 2013-04-27, version 0.7.1

- Improvements in the parser:
  - Added support for chained arguments.
  - Added support for chained variable assignments.
  - Added a function remove(name) to remove a variable from the parsers scope.
  - Renamed nodes for more consistency and to resolve naming conflicts.
  - Improved stringification of a node tree.
  - Some simplifications in the code.
  - Minor bug fixes.
- Fixed a bug in the parser, returning NaN instead of throwing an error for a
  number with multiple decimal separators like `2.3.4`.
- Fixed a bug in Workspace.insertAfter.
- Fixed: math.js now works on IE 6-8 too.


## 2013-04-20, version 0.7.0

- Implemented method `math.eval`, which uses a readonly parser to evaluate
  expressions.
- Implemented method `xgcd` (extended eucledian algorithm). Thanks Bart Kiers
  (@bkiers).
- Improved math.format, which now rounds values to a maximum number of digits
  instead of decimals (default is 5 digits, for example `math.format(math.pi)`
  returns `3.1416`).
- Added examples.
- Changed methods square and cube to evaluate matrices element wise (consistent
  with all other methods).
- Changed second parameter of method import to an object with options.
- Fixed method math.typeof on IE.
- Minor bug fixes and improvements.


## 2013-04-13, version 0.6.0

- Implemented chained operations via method math.select(). For example
  `math.select(3).add(4).subtract(2).done()` will return `5`.
- Implemented methods gcd and lcm.
- Implemented method `Unit.in(unit)`, which creates a clone of the unit with a
  fixed representation. For example `math.unit('5.08 cm').in('inch')` will
  return a unit which string representation always is in inch, thus `2 inch`.
  `Unit.in(unit)` is the same as method `math.in(x, unit)`.
- Implemented `Unit.toNumber(unit)`, which returns the value of the unit when
  represented with given unit. For example
  `math.unit('5.08 cm').toNumber('inch')` returns the number `2`, as the
  representation of the unit in inches has 2 as value.
- Improved: method `math.in(x, unit)` now supports a string as second parameter,
  for example `math.in(math.unit('5.08 cm'), 'inch')`.
- Split the end user documentation of the parser functions from the source
  files.
- Removed function help and the built-in documentation from the core library.
- Fixed constant i being defined as -1i instead of 1i.
- Minor bug fixes.


## 2013-04-06, version 0.5.0

- Implemented data types Matrix and Range.
- Implemented matrix methods clone, concat, det, diag, eye, inv, ones, size,
  squeeze, transpose, zeros.
- Implemented range operator `:`, and transpose operator `'` in parser.
- Changed: created construction methods for easy object creation for all data
  types and for the parser. For example, a complex value is now created
  with `math.complex(2, 3)` instead of `new math.Complex(2, 3)`, and a parser
  is now created with `math.parser()` instead of `new math.parser.Parser()`.
- Changed: moved all data types under the namespace math.type, and moved the
  Parser, Workspace, etc. under the namespace math.expr.
- Changed: changed operator precedence of the power operator:
  - it is now right associative instead of left associative like most scripting
    languages. So `2^3^4` is now calculated as `2^(3^4)`.
  - it has now higher precedence than unary minus most languages, thus `-3^2` is
    now calculated as `-(3^2)`.
- Changed: renamed the parsers method 'put' into 'set'.
- Fixed: method 'in' did not check for units to have the same base.
